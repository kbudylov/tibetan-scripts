This document defines the pecha "protocol" that is used to generate pechas of
varying formats from a single source document.

The source document must be in RTF format.
The document is comprised of text "packets": a triple of text lines.
Each packet consists of the following, separated by a new line:
    1) Tibetan in a Tibetan font
    2) Transliterated Tibetan in a Roman font
    3) Translation
Exceptions to this:
    * Document title (Sanskrit, Tibetan, English); the first three lines of the
      document are always treated as the title.
If a packet has no transliteration and/or no translation, the missing data is
replaced with a blank line.
If a packet has very long lines, it cannot have any other white space
characters than a single space (no new line characters).
