BUGS
----

We're getting repeats of blocks due to the line:
  self.document.sheets[i].blocks = self.blocks = newBlocks
in setupBlocks(). This needs to be changed so that only the *correct* blocks
(i.e., the pertinent block in the sheet) gets assigned the newBlocks variable.

Pecha's with less than 4 blocks currently seem to need to do the following in
order to produce accurate blocks:
  p = Pecha(2)
  s = Shee(p, 1)
That second line shouldn't be neccessary.

Pecha's with more than 8 blocks don't produce the corrent number of blocks, nor
do the block get the right numbers.
