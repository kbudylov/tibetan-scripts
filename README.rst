Tibetan Scripts
===============

This repo holds several utility scripts that I have used (and still do, from
time to time) for the manipulation of Tibetan text and/or PDF files.

Additionally, there are some libraries that are works in progress for doing
more complicated tasks. As they mature, I will update the README with more
details on usage, etc.
